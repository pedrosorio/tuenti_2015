I did ungodly things to that forth/html/javascript that you don't want to see. I will spare you the pain.



-> Removed the 1000 instruction limit that keeps re-starting the interpreter making things very slow
-> For loop in terminal.js to call the right forth functions in succession
-> Modified forth to add symbols that return the antena access code and the file name to the callback
-> Took 1 hour to figure out why I was getting the same image over and over again after I had randomized the Date()
-> curl to download + python to average the images
-> random smartphone app to read the QR code (you guys love QR codes don't you?)
