The solution to this problem can be obtained by doing a dp where the state is (room, stamina).

My solution is inefficient and somewhat clumsy because I decided to go about it the wrong way (bottom up)
and consider all possible (rooms,stamina) that could have led to the current position. The much more natural
approach to simulate the paths taken by the hero, would have been much easier to implement and more efficient.
